# AI Chatbot
Advanced chatbot written in batch file.

# Usage
Launch:
> src/AI.bat

To change language, you just need to copy a file from *"Data"* folder, paste it in *"src"* and rename it to *"data.db"*.

There are **4 debug informations**. You must look at prefix of "his" message:
 1. **DATA** - AI found an answer, you can ask another question.
 2. **TEMP** - You must answer AI's 'question' based on only 1 line.
 3. **NULL** - AI can't find an answer, you can ask another question.
 4. **FAIL** - Error occured.

You can also ignore these prefixes.

Modules support are also available. Type: **=module_name**.
 1. **CALC** - Calculation program, ex: '=2+2'.
 2. **TIME** - Shows date and time.
 3. **SORT** - Sorts database.
 4. **CLNN** - Cleans temporary sentences.
 5. **PING** - Pings multiple sites to check internet connection.
 6. **CLSC** - Cleans screen.
 7. **RSET** - Restarts AI without closing the window.
 8. **WINV** - Gets Windows version.
 9. **FCHK** - File checker.
 10. **EXIT** - Exits the program.


# Tip
Don't see your native language? You can create your own database. Just look at existing files in *"Data"* folder.
